<title>CounterLogic for webERP Operation</title>
<head><h1>CounterLogic for webERP</h1></head>
<body>
<h3>Introduction</h3>
<p>webERP's strengths are it's accessibility from anywhere, it's robust backend accounting, procurement, multi-currency, stock management etc. However, it is plainly unsuitable as the basis for interaction with customers, there is no facility to scan barcodes to enter items into a sale, calculate change, open a cash-drawer, print receipts automatically when a transaction is completed. This is where CounterLogic POS comes in, it has all these facilities expected of a modern Point of Sale system and is completely integrated with webERP. Any number of independent CounterLogic POS systems (lanes) can run simultaneously and together webERP and CounterLogic form an advanced integrated Retail Management System. POS lanes could be installed in any part of the world each operating in different currencies all integrated to a single webERP installation in a truly global and local business. The integrated retail management systems that could currently work under such conditions are very expensive and complex propositions indeed. The back office functions of receiving inventory, entering supplier invoices, printing customer statements, label printing etc can all be done currently from webERP. However, webERP lacks the interactivity that a client side GUI can provide with integration to scanner/printer/cash drawer. webERP also requires continuous connectivity to the web server hosting the webERP installation, this may not always be possible. CounterLogic POS provides the solution to webERP's shortcomings as a customer facing solution. With CounterLogic POS there is no requirement for 24x7 connectivity to the webERP server and it provides a fully interactive, optimised sales terminal that minimises the keying and maximises the accuracy of both sale and cash receipt recording. It is important to note that Counter Logic POS cannot currently deal with webERP's seriliased or controlled items.</p>
<br />
<h3>What Does Counter Logic POS Do?</h3>
<p>CounterLogic POS is an interactive POS system that is completely integrated - data including all inventory items, barcodes, prices, customers etc is retrieved over XML-RPC and sales created are sent back and processed remotely at the webERP server also using XML-RPC. Having retrieved the data from webERP about customers and items/pricing CounterLogic POS is then completely independent. This of course is a fundamental requirement of a POS system and in the absence of an internet connection the POS will cache sales made until the connection is up again. In addition, interactive search facilities are available and connection to local hardware and receipt printers/cash drawers make POS a more efficient operation relative to webERP's native web-based Counter Sales functionality. With customer facing software, the receipt should just print out and the cash drawer open so the customer is not waiting for an operator to click on the web-interface or because of network latency issues. Note that there is no integration into EFTPOS currently and EFTPOS receipts must be keyed into CounterLogic POS. There is an end of day reconciliation of cash/cheques/EFTPOS (in fact any of the payment methods/media defined in webERP) bankings to sales/takings report.</p>
<br />
<h3>Installation and Printer Setup</h3>
<p>A cash drawer connected to an Epson compatible (ESC/POS) receipt printer and a barcode scanner are required for any efficient POS operation. The web-server running webERP must also have the capability to compress zip files so that the transmission of the data is done efficiently. This requires that the PHP extension to zip files is installed.</p>
<h4>Windows</h4>
<p>Download the latest CounterLogic POS archive from http://www.logicworks.co.nz/Counter-Logic.html - Simply run the downloaded setup program.</p>
<p>To install a receipt printer there is some one off setup required. It is necessary to use a special printer driver which is installed using a utility provided and installed by the setup program. The printer driver installation utility is called Zadig.exe. It will be in C:\Program Files\CounterLogic (or another directory if it installed elsewhere). Run this program from explorer - under options click on devices list with your receipt printer plugged into a USB port. </p>
<p><img src="../images/Zadig.jpg"></p>
<p>It can be tricky to identify which device is the receipt printer, so if you pull the USB cord out and have another look the printer should have gone. Make sure you get the correct USB device for the printer and select it. Then select the WinUSB driver (which is the default) and click install. Keep a note of the USB product ID and the vendor ID reported by Zadig as these need to be entered into the CounterLogic options dialog to CounterLogic knows which device is the receipt printer. To enter the product ID and vendor ID of the USB printer into Counter Logic POS, run the POS (login as user &quot;a&quot; with password &quot;a&quot; unless you have already set up an administrative user) and ignore (click through) the warnings about there being no receipt printer attached. Click on Tools->Options to bring up the options dialog box then enter the ProductID and VendorID noted when installing the driver. Ensure you get the ProductID and VendorID around the right way. Logging off from Counter Logic POS and logging back in should see the warnings about no receipt printer gone.</p>
<br />
<p><a target="_blank" href="http://www.logicworks.co.nz/ReceiptPrinterInstall.mp4">Video showing how to install the printer</a>. Note that a windows driver is not required and should not be installed as this will take over the USB port and prevent the Counter Logic communicating with the printer.</p>
<h4>Technical details of Receipt Printer Support</h4>
<p>Printer support is provided using "pyusb" - the python USB library to communicate directly with the USB port that the printer is connected to. The pyusb python library and libusb-1.0 needs to be installed on a python installation for CounterLogic POS to work at all. A section of the pythons esc/pos code from Manuel Martinez has been used and incorporated into CounterLogic python scripts. These requirements are all handled by the windows setup script (using the libusbx libusb-1.0.dll which is copied to the windows system folder - the WinUSB driver communicates to the device through libusb-1.0.dll). This set up allows a single code base to be completely platform neutral.</p>
<br />
<p><h3>Quick Start - Configuration</h3></p>
<p />
<p>All data for the POS system must be retrieved over xml-rpc from webERP, so before starting it is necessary to configure the POS with the information required to connect to the webERP installation that will then populate the local database with all the data required to process sales - inventory, prices, customers etc.</p>
<p>There is an administrator user defined in the demo database user &quot;a&quot; password &quot;a&quot;, login with this account, select Tools -> Options. Here, all the configuration options can be accessed.</p>
<p><img src="../images/OptionsDialog.jpg"></p>
<p>It is possible to configure logins to expect any number of characters as a username and a specific number of characters for the password - so the operator does not need to take their hands off the keyboard. Userid of 1 character and password of 1 character is the default but in a live install at least three characters is recommended for user initials and password</p>
<p>
<ul>
<li>The webERP user name - this is a valid webERP user for this installation with access rights to the api functions</li>
<li>The webERP user password</li>
<li>The webERP api xml-rpc server address normally the webERP host with the extension /api/api_xml-rpc.php - e.g. If the master installation was the webERP demo database would be http://www.weberp.org/weberp/api/api_xml-rpc.php This is actually the script in the webERP installation that serves xml-rpc requests - which is how the data is retrieved from webERP - over port 80 - the normal web http protocol port</li>
<li>The default webERP customer that should be used for all sales coming from the POS as a default. It is also possible to create sales for other webERP customer accounts - but these must be specified directly, by selecting the customer in the POS. For sales where no customer is selected this default customer code is used. The POS uses this customer code to determine the currency of this POS installation. Only customers of this currency will be available to select and all sales of the POS are assumed to be in the currency of the default customer.</li>
<li>The default webERP customer branch that should be used for all sales coming from the POS as a default. For sales where no customer/branch is selected this default customer and branch code is used. <b>This customer/branch code combination must exist in the webERP installation.</b> If the customer set up in the options dialog does not exist in the webERP installation then the upload of data from webERP will fail. The currency of the POS is determined by reference to the currency of the default customer selected in this config option. Only customers that use this currency will be downloaded to the POS and allowed to be selected to sell to. Selecting the default branch for the default customer also determines the tax group of the POS. The tax group determines the taxes applicable to each sale - in conjunction with the tax province of the default location. Using the same logic that webERP uses. Also, the sales area and sales type of the customer branch combination determine how the sales eminating from this POS instance will be posted when the transactions are sent to webERP (via XML-RPC). webERP allows general ledger posting to be configured by sales area and the branch of the customer selected for the POS customer can be defined to be a specific sales area - perhaps a new sales area specifically for this customer branch so that sales analysis of that sales area will provide the analysis of just the POS sales. Of course, this analysis will not capture sales to customers other than the default POS customer.</li>
<li>The ID of this POS - so that sales from this POS are uniquely identified in webERP. This ID is propogated through to transactions created in the webERP install based on transactions sent from the particular CounterLogic POS installation.</li>
<li>The inventory location code of inventory sold from this POS - this is determined by reference to the customer and branch defined for the POS instance - the default location of the branch will be the inventory location that is used for all sales. Note that this location is used for all sales from this POS instance irrespective of the branch default location of any other customer that may be selected.</li>
<li>The receipt printer must be a USB ESC/POS (Epson compatible) receipt printer with a plug to accept a cash drawer connection. These are widely available. Once the receipt printer is turned on and plugged into the POS PC, the computer automatically identifies the USB device. The USB product ID and vendor ID need to be noted (from Zadig.exe), CounterLogic POS uses these details to communicate with the receipt printer and also to send the command to open the cash drawer as necessary. See notes above on how to set up the printer.</li>
<li>The POS can be configured to require a login for each sale. LoginEverySale should be set to 1 for this configuration. This ensures that the POS is not left logged in so an authorised person could access the cash drawer - as most cash drawers can only be opened with the software (or a key). It is also possible to set LoginEverySale to 0 so that a login is not required for every sale. The login dialog is optomised so that the number of characters required for the userid can be defined, as can the number of characters required for the password. When the number of characters required for the userid is reached the focus moves directly to the password entry. When the number of characters required for the password is reached the details are checked automatically without additional clicks.</li>
<li>In calculating the amount of change to give, CounterLogic POS needs to be aware of the smallest coin denomination. A number showing the amount of the currency that the smallest coin represents should be entered. Change will be calculated to the nearest of this denomination. Also, CounterLogic POS will record a rounding difference where cash is given and this will come through to webERP as a payment discount and be posted according to the webERP company record payment discount general ledger configuration</li>
<li>If a login is required for every sale then a 1 should be entered for LoginEverySale - otherwise a 0 means than a single login is required. In situations where the cash drawer needs to be secure LoginEverySale is recommended and is configured this way by default. The login is made simple and quick by enabling the length of the userid and password to be defined in the configuration. When the number of characters of the userid definition is reached the focus is automatically transferred to the password. When the password length is reached then the login details are checked automatically too. In this way the user does not need to take their hands off the keyboard.</li>
</ul>
<p>
Other configuration points:
</p>
<ul>
<li><b>In the webERP installation the api needs to be configured to use the correct webERP database</b>. The script under the webERP installation api directory called api_php.php line 6 defines a variable 	$api_DatabaseName='weberpdemo'; The default weberpdemo database name needs to be changed to whatever the company database is to be used. If you are using multiple companies with a single webERP installation and you wish to use CounterLogic POS with several of those companies then the api directory needs to be copied to another 3 character directory(important that the new directory name be just 3 characters long) under the webERP installation. The api URL can then be changed in the Counter Logic POS installations and the api_php.php in the new api directory can then be changed to refer to the other company database.</li>
<li>If there are a lot of stock items the timeout of your php installation may need to be changed. It is normally set to default 60 seconds. Examine your php.ini typically in /etc directory of your web server and alter the setting for max_execution_time = 600 and default_socket_timeout = 600 It may not be necessary to update this value for smaller databases.</li>
<li>Set up users. Only a system admin user can access the user screen under File -> User Maintenance. The default system admin user of userid="a" password="a" should be deleted.</li>
<li>Set up the webERP bank accounts to use for each webERP payment method. Under Tools -> Payment Method Mapping. The bank account entered should correspond to a valid webERP bank account (there is no error trapping so a mistake here will be fatal!). The payment methods imported from webERP will display (once the first webERP upload has been performed). In webERP the payment methods must be set up to show if the cash drawer needs to be opened when there is a sale and there is an amount tendered in the payment type. e.g. for an EFTPOS payment there is obviously no need to open the cash drawer to deposit money. However, if the payment method is cash or cheque then the operator will need to deposit the cash or cheque in the cash drawer and potentially give change.</li>
</ul>


<p><h4>Debugging the Communication Between Your webERP installation and Counter Logic POS</h4></p>
<p>
If you are unable to identify the problem in your configuration then here are some pointers:</p>
<ul>
	<li>When you run Linker.py full and you get ouput like:
		<blockquote>Traceback (most recent call last):<br />
		  File "/mnt/old_disk/home/phil/ownCloud/CounterLogic/Linker.py", line 367, in module<br />
			MakePOSUploadFile = x_server.weberp.xmlrpc_CreatePOSDataFull(Config['DebtorNo'],Config['BranchCode'],Config['webERPuser'],Config['webERPpwd'])<br />
		  File "/usr/lib/python2.7/xmlrpclib.py", line 1243, in __call__<br />
			return self.__send(self.__name, args)<br />
		  File "/usr/lib/python2.7/xmlrpclib.py", line 1602, in __request<br />
			verbose=self.__verbose<br />
		  File "/usr/lib/python2.7/xmlrpclib.py", line 1283, in request<br />
			return self.single_request(host, handler, request_body, verbose)<br />
		  File "/usr/lib/python2.7/xmlrpclib.py", line 1316, in single_request<br />
			return self.parse_response(response)<br />
		  File "/usr/lib/python2.7/xmlrpclib.py", line 1491, in parse_response<br />
			p.close()<br />
		  File "/usr/lib/python2.7/xmlrpclib.py", line 567, in close<br />
			parser.Parse("", 1) # end of data<br />
		xml.parsers.expat.ExpatError: no element found: line 1, column 0<br />
		http://weberp.org/weberp/api/api_xml-rpc.php<br />
		</blockquote>
Then this looks like the xml-rpc call to CreatePOSDataFull is not working - this is the webERP api method to create the zip file of the necessary data to download to the POS. This method code is in the webERP/api/api_webERPSettings.php script and calls a function CreatePOSDataFull which is in turn in includes/Z_POSDataCreation.php. In the Counter Logic code there is a script Z_POS_Data.php that will call this function and create the data archive. Upload this script to the webERP installation and enter the URL to run it http://YourServer/webERP/Z_POS_Data.php enter the parameters and run the POS data creation function. If it fails with the message ERROR Report : Unable to create POS Data file. In most cases a more specific message will be returned identifying why it failed. If this function fails then problem lies with the webERP installation - it is nothing to do with the api configuration.</li>
<li>If the Z_POS_Data.php fails to make the data file then it could be for a number of reasons - the most likely being that the zip compression module is not enabled in the php installation on the web-server. Or the server permissions set do not allow creation of files in the companies/your_company_db/reportwriter/ folder</li>
<li>Check again that the webERP installation/api/api-php.php file has the correct database name on line 6 - $api_DatabaseName='YOUR_webERP_DATABASE_NAME';</li>
</ul>

<br />
<h3>Populating Local Database with Data</h3>
<br />
<p>With the configuration complete and network connectivity to the webERP server confirmed, the local CounterLogic POS database can be populated from the webERP installation by clicking on Tools->Update Data From webERP. This initiates the Linker program to retrieve the data from the webERP install. If the configuration has all been done correctly CounterLogic POS will be populated with the live webERP data automatically. However, if the process fails there is not much feedback on what happened. However, the Linker writes a log of what happened in the data directory data/Linker.log look at this file with a text editor to see what happened. For more detail on what happened the Linker must be run from the command line.</p>
<p><img src="../images/ToolsMenu.jpg"></p>
<p> A message will come up on screen showing the program was successful in uploading the necessary data from webERP. As this process can take a long time to complete depending on the size of the data it is really better to run it from a command line, this also then shows the feedback and completion of each stage of the job. Open a windows command window (run - cmd) and:</p>
<br /><blockquote><code>run cmd
<br />cd C:\Program Files\CounterLogic
<br />Linker.exe full</code></blockquote>
<br />
<p>This process needs to be run everytime there is an update of customers/inventory items in webERP. This can take quite a bit of time in a large installation (tested with 1.3 million record stockmaster ~20 minuites), so it is best to do it over-night where possible and schedule a job to do it automatically so it never needs to be thought about. It only needs to be done when there are changes to the webERP item master, pricing or new customers etc. If the upload fails there will be no data that will have been updated. A log of the activity of the linker is recorded in Linker.log under the data directory where CounterLogic POS is installed.</p>
<br />
<h3>What is Going On Here - Background</h3>
<br />
<p>
This process sends an xml-rpc request to the webERP server to create the POS upload data file and compress it as a zip file for downloading. Once complete, it downloads the file, extracts it and executes the SQL into the CounterLogic database (sqlite). Originally data was retrieved with individual calls to the webERP api but this was too slow for large databases. Preparing the export as an SQL file on the webERP server, compressing it and downloading it onto the POS machine is a much more efficient transport the xml-rpc and the process is very fast by comparison. However, if the webERP database is very large it may be necessary to change the webERP config.php to extend the $MaximumExecutionTime a figure of ~20 minutes (1200 seconds) for the period of time it will take webERP to create the upload file. This time has been shown to cope with a 1.3 million record item database. The webERP web-server must have the zip extension module to php installed to create the compressed download.
</p>
<p></p>
<h3>Searching for Items</h3>
<p></p>
<p>From the File Menu select Search Items. Alternatively click the "Search Items" button (or press ALT+I). The search dialog box will open. Enter any character in the search box and the system will search for items where the item code contains this character in any inventory category. Select an inventory category and the search will be reperformed using the character but now only items belonging to the inventory category selected. If the description radio button is selected the search will be redone showing only items where the character occurs anywhere in the description of the item and the the item is in the inventory category selected.<p>
<p>The search is redone each time any entry is made. Double click on any item in the search list (or select the item and click on OK) and it is added automatically to the sale screen.</p>
<p />
<p></p>
<h3>Sales to Customers</h3>
<p></p>
By default all cash sales are processed by the POS against the default customer and branch as defined in the configuration options - all these sales are assumed to be cash sales - i.e. where payment is effected at the point of sale before the goods are taken. However, it is also possible to charge up sales to customer accounts, other than the default customer from a POS sale.
From the File Menu select Search Customers. Alternatively click the "Search Customers" button (or press ALT+C). The search dialog box will open. Enter any character in the search box and the system will search for customers where the customer code contains the character entered. Entering additional characters will refine the search.  It is also possible to check the box for searching by the customer's name.
<p></p>
<h3>Entering Sales</h3>
<p />
<p>If the sale is a cash sale then items can be scanned immediately to add them to the sale. However, if the sale is to be charged or a portion of the sale is to be charged to a customer account then the customer must be selected first - if there is specific pricing for the customer defined in webERP then this will then be used for the sale. To select a customer the Select Customer dialog must be opened by clicking the "Select Customer" button - entering any part of the customer code or name will find all those customers in the webERP database (as imported) that match. It is important to realise that only customers in the same currency as the default cash sale customer for this POS will be imported from webERP so it is not possible to do multi-currency sales (A separate CounterLogic POS instance is required for this).</p>
<br />
<p>When the sales screen is up, the focus by default is in the scan entry field. Scanning a product code or barcode will add one of the item scanned to the sale, the price is calculated inclusive of the taxes due based on the net price imported from webERP, but plus the tax due based on the customer (or default customer) selection and the tax group of that customer and the tax category of the item - see the webERP documentation for tax calculation. This is all invisible in the POS and just the gross tax inclusive price appears to show the customer total to pay.</p>
<p>If there is no barcode on the product to scan then it is possible to click on "Search Items" to find a specific product. Any part of the code or description can be entered and all the matching items will display. A double click on the item in the search dialog will add it to the sale. The search dialog can then be closed and the sale completed.</p>
<p>Subsequent scans will increment the quantity by 1 of this item, rather than adding new lines.</p>
<p>If the quantity is to be amended it is possible to TAB or click into the grid of items and arrow up and down the list. When the focus is on a row pressing the + key increases the quantity by 1 and pressing the - key reduces the quantity by 1. When the quantity is 0 the system removes it from the grid completely. Pressing delete on a row also removes it from the grid and the sale. To return an item the quantity must be entered as a negative, it is not possible to use the - key to enter a return, the return quantity must be specifically entered as a negative quantity using the keyboard.<p>
<p>If the price is to be amended it is possible to click on the price of the item to be amended the price can then be changed. The tax calculations also alter based on the new gross price - all prices in the POS are assumed to be inclusive of taxes. The sale recalculates (as does the tax behind the scenes). Similarly if the quantity is to be amended for a particular item click on the sale grid quantity field and edit the quantity as needed.</p>
<p>The total amount of the sale and the total amount of tax included in the sale is shown below the entry grid</p>
<p />
<h3>Payment Screen</h3>
<p />
<p>To complete a sale it is necessary to collect payment from the customer - through any of the payment methods defined on the webERP installation. All these methods will have come down with the data from the webERP upload.</p>
<p><img src="../images/PaymentDialog.jpg"></p>
<p>The payment screen shows a button for each of the webERP payment methods and the relevant button must be clicked to enter an amount against that payment method. When one of the payment method buttons are clicked CounterLogic POS assumes that the entire amount of the sale is assumed to be being paid and the amount defaulted accordingly. If only part of the sale is being paid using this payment method then the amount must be changed before hitting enter. Clicking another payment method will assume that the entire balance is being paid and so on. Any number of payment methods can be used to settle a sale. If the sale is to a customer other than the default POS customer then an additional button will display for the amount to charge to the customers account - i.e. no payment is to be made today. If the account is to be charged (and no other payment method is selected) then the cash drawer will not open. Any combination of payment methods can be used. If the total of all payments entered exceeds the amount of the sale then the cash drawer will open on completion and a dialogue will show the amount of change to be given. The amount of change to be given will factor in the smallest denomination coin (set in the configuration options), so that only a valid amount of change will be shown. If the configuration is set to print receipts with each sale then a receipt for the sale will print to the default printer.  There is an option to print the last receipt from the menu irrespective of whether the auto print receipt feature is active or not. Many customers do not require a receipt so tuning auto receipt printing off will save on paper.</p>
<p> </p>
<p><b>Warning:</b> On sending the sale to webERP an order is created for each customer transaction for all transactions that have not already been sent to webERP. An invoice is created for each transaction and referenced back to the POS transaction in the customerref field in webERP. However, the invoice is created in webERP using the webERP logic for the lines of the invoice using the logic and data as at the time of the import, so if the data in webERP has changed since the data that the POS had at the time of the sale then it is possible that the tax might be calculated differently. The net price comes accross from the POS with the order, but the tax group of the customer and the tax authority rates etc will all be as per the last import from webERP into the POS as at the time of the POS sale. Since this data is quite static the risk of changes are small and thus acceptable. However, when tax rates change it is very important to ensure that data is sent to webERP before the change, then the new rates updated in webERP, immediately downloaded into the POS before any new transactions. Happily tax rates do not change frequently and this will rarely be an issue for anyone.
<p>
<br />
<h3>The Linker program</h3>
<p />
This program manages the communication with webERP. It can be run with either the &quot;send&quot; parameter to send transactions back to webERP or the &quot;full&quot; parameter to upload the standing webERP data required for operation (customers/branches/items/categories/payment terms/payment methods etc). The linker is run from either the menu option inside the CouterLogic GUI (from Tools->Update webERP Data or Tools->Send data to webERP). These processes can take a little time depending on the amount of data being transferred, so it is better to run them out of hours and ideally scheduled to run automatically as they can be run from the command line with:
<p>
<br />Windows:
<br />run cmd
<br />&gt;cd C:\Program Files\CounterLogic
<br />&gt;Linker.exe full
</p>
or to send transactions created at the POS to be processed in webERP:
<p>
<br />Windows:
<br />run cmd
<br />&gt;cd C:\Program Files\CounterLogic
<br />&gt;Linker.exe send
</p>
<p>Running the Linker.exe from a command window shows the progress of the action with output messages - there is no indication of what is going on when run from the GUI. However, the Linker.exe does create a Linker.log file in the CounterSales\data folder which is a text file showing the activity. With the full parameter all the webERP data required for the POS is refreshed. If the &quot;send&quot; parameter is used then all the new transactions are sent to webERP and allocated to each other where possible using the webERP XML-RPC api calls. The rationale for making it possible to run this program from the command line is so that it can be scheduled to run in the background to automatically ensure all transactions are propogated to webERP without any user intervention. By running it from a command line any error messages are shown in the command window.</p>
<p>
The linker requires a valid license to work - please contact support@logicworks.co.nz to purchase a license. All licenses are time limited. It will actually work without a valid licence just once so it is possible to see CounterLogic POS in action with the business's data without purchasing a licence. However, it is not then possible to use the linker again until a licence is purchased. The point of sale is really only useful in conjunction with your live webERP data so is actually useless without the linker.
</p>
<br />
<h3>How it Works</h3>
<p>The communication with the webERP web-server over XML-RPC is handled by a separate "Linker.exe" program that can run in the background and be set to syncronise sales made at the POS with webERP every X number of minutes. This program also handles the uploading of the latest webERP data for customers and items on periodic basis. It is also possible to run the linker full upload from the main POS menu directly. Syncronisation of sales must be done through the linker and the linker can be invoked to send transactions directly from the CounterLogic POS screen.</p>
<p><h3>Requirements</h3></p>
<p>CounterLogic is developed in the popular scripting language, Python using the GTK (Gimp Tool Kit) GUI widgets. The POS can be used under Windows or Linux. A windows .exe can be downloaded from http://www.logicworks.co.nz/Counter-Logic.html. Note also that because CounterLogic POS uses the webERP API, and this API has been extended to cope with the requirements of CounterLogic POS, it is important that webERP version 4.08.2 or greater is being used.</p>
<p />
<h3>Technical Details</h3>
<p>
<ul>
<li>Communication between the POS and webERP is conducted using the xmlrpc module that is one of the standard modules in python.</li>
<li>The user interface is written using the Gtk library (Gimp Tool-Kit) this in turn needs Glib and Gdk (which is available for Windows and *nix)</li>
<li>Sqlite database system is used by the POS to store data locally. The Sqlite python module is therefore used extensively by the POS to query and insert/update the data in the Sqlite database. Again this is bundled with Python</li>
<li>Hardware requirements are minimal to run the program, but a cash drawer, receipt printer and a barcode scanner operating in a keyboard wedge configuration are essential for any proper customer efficient POS system</li>
<li>Receipt printing is implemented using libusb-1.0 and pyusb - the python extension that enables direct USB access. These requirements are all handled with the windows installer.</li>
</ul>
<br />
<h3>Multi-Language Possibilities</h3>
<p>
The application can run in either Chinese or English. To make another translation take the file under Languages\en_GB\LC_MESSAGES\messages.pot and make a new directory under the Languages directory with your country locale code eg de_DE for German and copy this file under a sub-directory LC_MESSAGES with the extension .po. Edit the file to include your transactions for each of the strings in this file - a process needs to be run on the transalated messages.po file to convert it to an indexed binary format that can be used (if you have the gettext tools run msgfmt messages.po to create the new messages.mo). Since the application only consists of a few screens it is not a big job to translate it. Submit the translation to support@logicworks.co.nz and a version for your language will be produced. With a translation file it is trival for us to alter the program to use your new translation</p>

<h3>Trouble Shooting</h3>
<p>
If there is a problem running CounterLogic run it directly from a command line as the terminal will show useful information to determine where the problem lies. Open a terminal window:</p>
<br />&gt;C:\\Program Files\CounterLogic\CounterLogic.exe
<p>Please report issues copying the output in the command window/terminal screen to support@logicworks.co.nz</p>

<h4>Although it is quite upsetting ... Linux is not supported currently - the installation is difficult sadly</h4>
<br />
<br />
<h4>Linux Mint</h4>
<p>Ensure python 2.7 is installed from a terminal:</p>
<blockquote>
<i>sudo apt-get python
<br/>sudo apt-get python-gtk2-dev
</i>
</blockquote>
As of Linux Mint Oliva (15) the python-usb package is old and the latest pyserial and pyusb for libusb-1.0 must be installed from:
<br/><a href="http://sourceforge.net/projects/pyusb/files/PyUSB%201.0/1.0.0-alpha-3/">Sourceforge http://sourceforge.net/projects/pyusb/files/PyUSB%201.0/</a>
<br/>Download the latest and extract then go to the place where you extracted it and run:
<blockquote>
<i>sudo python setup.py install</i>
</blockquote>
<p>Now <a href="https://pypi.python.org/pypi/pyserial">download</a> and <a href=http://pythonhosted.org/pyserial/pyserial.html#installation">install</a> <a href="http://pythonhosted.org/pyserial/">pyserial</a></p>
<p>Python serial module is required for integration with serial EFTPOS terminals</p>
<p>When CounterLogic POS is run without a receipt printer attached a message shows that there is no receipt printer - and therefore CounterLogic with not be able to open a cashdrawer - as this happens through sending control codes to the receipt printer. To identify the printer it is necessary to see the devices connected to the USB interface from a terminal type:</p>
<blockquote>
<i>lsusb</i>
</blockquote>
<p>By plugging the USB printer in and running the above command it should be possible to identify the printers ID and vendor ID. The output of lsusb is typically:</p>
<blockquote>
<i>Bus 001 Device 002: ID 8087:0024 Intel Corp. Integrated Rate Matching Hub
<br/>Bus 002 Device 002: ID 8087:0024 Intel Corp. Integrated Rate Matching Hub
<br/>Bus 001 Device 001: ID 1d6b:0002 Linux Foundation 2.0 root hub
<br/>Bus 002 Device 001: ID 1d6b:0002 Linux Foundation 2.0 root hub
<br/>Bus 001 Device 003: ID 064e:a302 Suyin Corp.
<br/>Bus 001 Device 005: ID 0cf3:3005 Atheros Communications, Inc. AR3011 Bluetooth
<br/>Bus 002 Device 003: ID 046d:c52e Logitech, Inc.lsusb</i>
</blockquote>
<p>In the above example the USB receipt printer is </p>
<blockquote>
<i>Bus 002 Device 003: ID 046d:c52e Logitech, Inc.lsusb</i>
</blockquote>
The Device Product ID is therefore: 046d
<br />and the Vendor ID is: c52e
<p>These parameters must be set up in Counter Logic POS configuration to identify the USB device that is the printer - see below. The printer driver for any ESC/POS receipt printer is already defined inside Counter Logic POS. No other work is required to set up the printer.</p>
